      "content": ["I feel like this was a weird week. I felt both very productive, and like I got nothing done. As far as JS libraries go, however, React seems like a very useful one. After the hours and hours of tutorials I went through this week, I can see how powerful of a framework this is. I like the fact that it cuts out any need to use mamp, and that you can also blend html and javascript in the same file with seemingly wild abandon. However, at this stage, it is still a bit convoluted to me. The price for these new powers seems to be extra file structures, and having to lots of importing/ exporting of code from one place to another. I am really looking forward to when these concepts get more comfortable, and less foreign to me.", "I would definitely like to learn more about what React can do. I also feel like I have barely scratched to surface of how it can be used. I am excited to learn more about it. Just doing a quick google search, I know there are also lots of other frameworks and libraries out there. One in particular that caught my attention is Multiple.js. It allows you to take a background image and share it with multiple elements on a page. I think it would be really cool to implement in an aesthetically pleasing user interface."]

      "content": ["Week seven was definitely a doozy, but I made it through! In thinking forward to final project ideas, a few things I thought of could be: an app for saving and updating progress on knitting projects, some sort of online shop, or maybe a solitaire game? I don’t know about that last one though. I’m just pulling ideas out of my butt.", "I feel like the more that I use javascript, the easier it becomes to use and the more uses I can find for it. I feel like I am at a point where I have a couple of projects under my belt that have given me a lot more confidence with different ways that I can use it. I feel like the part I am struggling with the most is being able to look at the big picture of a program. I feel like I am able to figure out the small pieces, but struggle to put them together.", "I am definitely infestered in learning more about classes in javascript. I feel like it was a bit of a steep learning curve to have them introduced alongside something as complex as the calculator project. I feel like I am starting to get a vague grasp of what makes them work, but I know there’s a lot there to learn. I am excited to be able to implement them though, because I feel like they will be a very powerful tool.", "I definitely like the idea of the MVC design pattern. It feels like a very natural design process to me and I feel like it might be what I’ve been doing subconsciously anyway. As for other design patterns, I remember that we discussed the factory pattern briefly. I feel like that is a good model of how inheritance works in the class structure."]

      "content": ["Hello week six! It feels really weird to be writing the post for this whole week on a Tuesday. But after feeling so behind all of last week, it feels good to have dived right in and be ahead of the game. One thing that really helped me this week was jumping into the actual work sooner and not bogging myself with reading. I tend to read through the material slowly and feel like I don’t retain much.", "I feel like like the secret to writing good code is to think ahead as much as possible and plan things out. I found that pseudo coding came in really handy in the last couple of projects. Even just drawing shapes helps if I don’t know what to write. I have also been trying to make things as neat and readable as possible. I think being a good developer means that you are always willing to learn and collaborate with others. Also, when you collaborate, you can learn more things, faster! As for one thing that developers hate doing: I think that would have to be spending a lot of time on a solution and realizing that it’s not going to work and you have to delete it completely. Not that I have personal experience or anything."]

      "content": ["I found this week to be very challenging. As I type this, I am still not done with my last project and I did not manage to complete any stretch goals. I’m not really sure that I can pinpoint what in particular held me back this week. I’m sure it was a lot of small factors, like getting used to a new environment, a long commute, and a brand new sleep schedule. But it also feels like everything I did took an excruciatingly long time. I feel like my brain is this loose, saggy muscle that hasn’t been used in a long time and has atrophied. Specifically, I struggled the most with the mind reader project.", "At this point the thing I would like to learn more about is the practical applications of javascript. I feel like there are bits and pieces of it that I know and am comfortable with, but I am still struggling with connecting those pieces together to make something logical and cohesive. I don’t think there’s anything I can really do about this other that to simply write more code? I also like the idea of JSON, but am still a little foggy on specifics of how to use it, like how to make sure it’s linked correctly. As for data structures, I feel kind of okay with arrays and objects and how to access info from them and add and remove things. Strings on the other hand are the bane of my existence.", "I felt pretty okay with using bootstrap and atomic design this week. I’m not sure that there’s anything specifically I would like to know more about. I feel pretty comfortable with basic design elements, and it feels like kind of a fluid process to me. A lot of moving things around until they look the most pretty. I found bootstrap to be a little bit clunky to use at times, but I’m sure the more I use it the more comfortable I will become."]

      "content": ["I can’t believe I’m at the end of week four! I am grateful for having had this grace period to sort of ease myself into the flow of things, but if I’m being perfectly honest, I am really ready to get the heck out of my house.", "I would say that over all, I enjoyed the topics that were covered in pre work. A lot of things were review for me, but I learned some new things as well. I was intimidated by some of the new things at first, for instance, getting used to navigating a Mac OS, and using MAMP and Github. But now I feel like I’m at a place where I definitely feel more comfortable. Another big things for me was filling in the gaps in knowledge that I had. I have studied JS quite a bit on my own, but a lot of the things I was learning seemed abstract. For instance, I knew how to add and remove things from an array, but I had no context. Like, this is cool and all, but when would I use this and why? I have enjoyed working on practical projects that show me how to make that connection. No more writing useless code in a vacuum, but seeing how it translates to a real world application.", "One of the complaints for me about the pre work period was the fact that it is done remotely. It was nice to have access to the slack channel and knowing that I had the option to ask for help via zoom, but I’ve been learning on my own for so long that I feel like my brain is wired to do everything by myself. I am much more likely to ask for help if there is a person physically nearby to ask. But that’s more on me than anything. My only other real dislike about pre work was the amount of reading. It was all good information, but there was a lot of it. I did feel a little bogged down by it at times.", "But all in all this was a good week. The clock and timer projects were definitely tricky. I got stuck several times, but Google and the Mozilla docs were definitely my friends. I also looked at some projects that people had posted on code pen. I made sure though that I didn’t just copy and paste, especially since a lot of them included code that didn’t apply to what I was specifically wanting to do. But it definitely helped seeing different approaches to the same idea, and slowly breaking down the logic until I understood how it works and was able to apply it to my own code."]

      "content": ["Week three complete! Last week I felt very on top of my work load, unfortunately this week was a little more chaotic. Due to the long weekend I felt like I was lagging from the beginning. I also felt bogged down by the small mountain of reading, but managed to push through.", "This week was a little bit of a mixed bag on how I felt about the material. Some of it was review, but there were also a few new concepts I learned about. Before this bootcamp I had used quite a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But I never really understood how deep you can get into CSS. The sheer amount of different ways you can select things in an HTML document is very overwhelming. JavaScript was similar for me. I am pretty comfortable with a couple of key concepts that I have practiced a lot in the past. Loops for example. I love me a good for loop. I still find my self getting overwhelmed, however, when I try to put multiple concepts together, like when a function starts to get more and more layers, and when the variables add up. I start to get a little nervous and sweaty.", "As for blog updates I played around a bit with adding a navbar at the top. I did cheat slightly. I copied it from a portfolio I put together when I was working through the free code camp curriculum. So… It is code that I wrote, I just wrote it over a year ago. I did have to tweak it to better fit this new blog situation. I also had fun playing with gradients and box shadow. I added some links new pages, now all I have to do is figure out some content to put on those pages."]

      "content": ["I made it through week two of code camp! Hooray! I feel like this week was much less overwhelming. Here’s to hoping I can keep up the pace. I was actually a little bit ahead of schedule, which you would think would be a good thing, but instead it just made me panic and feel like I must’ve forgotten something. I will admit, I was kind of dreading the pseudo coding assignment this week, but as I got into it, I found myself enjoying it. I was reminded of the saying, “how do you eat an elephant?”. Simple answer, one piece at a time.", "I decided to write pseudo code for my computerized sewing machine. I think it helped to choose an object with a very simple computer that I am already familiar with. Even still, it was still quite a challenge. It was very intimidating to see it as “the whole elephant”, but by taking it one piece at a time I was able to get through it. The hardest part was figuring out one piece of the puzzle, only to realize that in order for that piece to make sense, you need three other pieces to back it up. Or not being able to find a piece that you need, only to realize it was in front of you the whole time. You just gave it a stupid name.", "I am sure the more that I pseudo code, the more comfortable I will become with it. I think one of my struggles in the past with coding, has been getting too wrapped up in syntax and method, but having no idea how it applies to the big picture. I am excited to get better at pseudo code to help me better visualize the big picture."]

      "content": ["My first week of bootcamp went about how I expected it too. There has certainly been a lot of new information to absorb. Like, seriously, a lot of information. It has been a bit overwhelming but I at least feel more knowledgeable than I did at the beginning of the week. So far my biggest struggle as been with using Git and GitHub. Although I’m sure the more I use it, to more sense it will make to me. I actually had to set up the files for this blog twice, because I accidentally overrode my first index file with an older version. I didn’t know what to do so I just deleted everything and started over, but I did feel more confident setting it up the second time. I am excited to learn more about Git and GitHub, since I am sure we will be using it a lot."]
