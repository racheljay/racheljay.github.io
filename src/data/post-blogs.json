        "Three months into the job hunt. And still we press on.",

        "This has definitely been a month of both highs and lows. On the plus side, I feel as though I had a lot of interviews and job leads this month. But on the less positive side, most of those leads turned into rejections. It is not a great feeling to do a lot of prep work and practice for an interview, think it has gone well, and then receive a no. I suppose one good thing to come out of this is that it forced me to become more comfortable with PHP and mySQL. I won’t lie and say that backend is my favorite part of development, but I know that it is an area that I can continue to improve in.",

        "After receiving so many no thank you’s, I retreated back to my happy place to get some easy wins. It’s React. My happy place is React. I finished converting my old Mind Reader project (which was not as seamless as I thought it was going to be), and allowed myself to have some fun playing with styling and picking out nice fonts and icons. Like I mentioned, it was definitely not as simple and straightforward as I thought it was going to be, but definitely a good refresher and good practice for keeping my React skills sharp. I also got some good practice with stepping in when Bootstrap and custom CSS decide that they are going to wage war with one another. Don’t worry, a truce was achieved.",

        "For this next month I will be changing gears again but only slightly. After losing a bunch of PHP opportunities, I wound up with a bunch of Wordpress ones. So still some PHP. Wordpress has been one of those things that I have been avoiding, because I have heard it can be frustrating to use, especially if you are a developer. I’ve not had much experience with CMS in general, since my projects have all be small and it made sense to do everything from scratch. So this will be something new to learn. Thankfully, as always, Free Code Camp has my back and I have their free five hour Wordpress course on my to watch list.",

        "Bonus Paragraph: Okay so this has nothing to do with code, but is relevant to being a lifelong learner, so I’m gonna talk about it anyway. 안녕하세요! I’ve decided to learn Korean! I think it’s a beautiful language and it’s been really interesting learning a new alphabet and sounding out words like a small child again. Flashback to being in kindergarten and learning about The Letter People for the first time. There’s nothing like being caught up in the excitement of learning something new and making slow but gradual progress. With all of the work I have put into coding recently, it has been nice to pick up a new skill that’s not for work or a potential job, but just for me, and for my own fun and personal enjoyment."

        "It’s been officially two full months since bootcamp. What have I been up to?",

        "This month I got very frustrated with seeing so many job listings requesting languages that I don’t know. So this month I decided to pick up Python! I did a couple of basic code-alongs and I really enjoy it so far. I find it very readable and it seems to have a lot of good libraries that you can import from. I decided to push my progress to GitHub and keep a readme file with notes on what I’ve learned doing each new project, so that I can look back on it later. It has been a little odd getting used to the syntax. I almost feel naked without all of my {} and ;.",

        "That being said, halfway through the month I suddenly had several leads for PHP jobs so I had to suddenly shift gears and go back into PHP mode. I have a love hate relationship with PHP. It is definitely not my favorite language to work with, but it does have a lot of great built in functions. And most of those functions have entertaining names. So there’s that. I definitely have a lot more to learn about PHP though. One interview I had gave me a PHP assignment that I felt totally lost with. I think that I am pretty comfortable with the basic syntax, but I still struggle with some of the more advanced features that PHP has. In this assignment, I wasn’t even sure what to google to figure out how to accomplish what I needed to do, so that was very frustrating. During bootcamp, most of what we did with PHP was directly involved in using Laravel, so I feel a little lost without a framework. But if I keep getting PHP leads, I guess I’m going to have to change that.",

        "In other news, I was also able to get started with my side-gig this month! (Actually if I’m being honest, I’m still unemployed. It’s my only gig). I’m an after school coding coach! I’ve only attended one session so far, but I already love it. Basically I am there to help kids along while they learn Python amongst other things. The key is offering help, but not solutions. After all learning how to learn is what’s most important. I’m really glad Awesome Inc has this program, and I wish I’d had access to something similar when I was young.",

        "Now let’s talk about the job search. There have been many ups and downs for sure. I have mostly been able to keep up with my goal of applying to at least one job per day, if not more. I’ve been trying to personalize my cover letter and resume for each position, but some companies are harder to do that with than others. It’s sometimes hard to explain why I want to work somewhere when I am not even fully aware of what they do. I’ve had a couple of interviews this month but the feedback has been mostly the same. “You know, we’re really looking for someone with more experience”.  I’ve seen a lot of memes about how difficult it is to find entry level jobs in this field. Most of them point out all of the unrealistic expectations a lot of companies have, but without offering any real solutions. They’re just like, “Haha, yeah. Good luck!”. Anyway, as frustrating as it is there’s nowhere to go but forward. Onward! Never give up. Never surrender."

        "This has not only been the first full month of 2021 but also my first full month outside of bootcamp. After a bit of a bumpy start, I think I have finally settled into a steady work flow.",
        "Last month I was having trouble staying organized so I decided to schedule out my days, hour by hour on google calendar. This turned out to not work for me at all. I would miss things and then feel awful for falling behind, which would then start a domino effect of low productivity and frustration for the rest of the day. After about a week of this, I transitioned to a much more simple schedule of job hunting before lunch, and then coding in the afternoon. Starting with a job application feels like an easy win and gets me pumped for the rest of my day. So far this is working for me a lot better.",
        "Speaking of job applications, I have been doing a lot of them! I have mostly been able to stick to my goal which is to try and apply for at least one job a day. I have gotten a few rejections so far, but I am trying to stay motivated. It has been a little frustrating, because there seems to be a lot of demand for senior developers, or for developers who know languages I haven’t learned yet, and not very much demand for junior developers. This has been a little discouraging, but the only thing I can do is keep moving forward, keep applying, and keep learning.",
        "I have also been able to get some work done on refactoring some of my old projects. This portfolio is something that I seem to be constantly tweaking, but I was also able to add two new projects to my projects page this month! I now have a completed todo list and a calculator! The todo list was our first project with React, and I remember struggling with it quite a bit. It was kind of funny to go back and perk it up now that I have so much more experience under my belt. The calculator was one of our last vanilla JS projects, and that was definitely a big challenge during week 3. I pretty much started that project from scratch, once again using React. It was still a bit of a challenge, and it still needs additional work, but I am proud of the basic functionality I have currently. I plan to revisit it and add improvements and also look at some of my other projects very soon.",
        "Next month, I am hoping to keep going strong with getting a lot of applications in, and to also get plugged into some more networking events. I feel there was not too much going on in January, what with people slowly getting back into the groove after Christmas. I am definitely looking to make some more professional connections and to get my name out into the world. This month had its ups and downs for sure, but I am determined to keep moving onward and upward."

        "Happy new year! I will admit, December was a slow month for me, as it probably was for a lot of people, but I think a little bit of down time was deserved after finishing a whole bootcamp! Holy crap! But don’t worry, I didn’t just veg out for the whole rest of the year. Here are some of the highlights:",
        "I finished some code wars katas! I have a bit of a love hate relationship with code wars. It is an excellent way to work your brain and really think about logic problems. It can also be very rage inducing.  There was one kata I was pleased with specifically. At first glance I was sure I would have to use a nested loop, which seems messy, and a bit slow. I was able to solve it without having to use a nested loop by using sort and building an object instead. Not the shortest or cleanest code I’ve written, but I feel like it was a unique way to approach the problem.",
        "I attended my first networking event! I will be honest. I hate the idea of networking. I am an introvert, and I also hate ‘schmoozing’ and trying to sell myself. But this one was actually super fun. I attended the Women, Innovators, Founders & Leaders meetup for December. Even though it was more of a casual ‘Christmas Party’ meetup (via Zoom), I feel like I was still able to make some good connections and gain useful information.",
        "I applied for some jobs! I know that this will probably be a lengthy and ongoing process, but I got the ball rolling at least. Applying for the first job was the most nerve wracking. Completely changing career paths like this is very stressful. The imposter syndrome is real, since I’ve never actually worked in this field before. I hope an employer will take pity on me soon and put me out of my job hunting misery, but until then, I’m going to keep working on my portfolio, sharpening my skills, and learning new things."
