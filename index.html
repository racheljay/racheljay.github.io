        <h2>Week one</h2>
        <h3>August 28, 2020</h3>
        <p>My first week of bootcamp went about how I expected it too. There has certainly been a lot of new information to absorb. Like, seriously, a lot of information. It has been a bit overwhelming but I at least feel more knowledgeable than I did at the beginning of the week. So far my biggest struggle as been with using Git and GitHub. Although I’m sure the more I use it, to more sense it will make to me. I actually had to set up the files for this blog twice, because I accidentally overrode my first index file with an older version. I didn’t know what to do so I just deleted everything and started over, but I did feel more confident setting it up the second time. I am excited to learn more about Git and GitHub, since I am sure we will be using it a lot.</p>
