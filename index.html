      <h2>Week three</h2>
      <h3><time datetime="2020-09-11">September 11, 2020</time></h3>
      <p>Week three complete!  Last week I felt very on top of my work load, unfortunately this week was a little more chaotic. Due to the long weekend I felt like I was lagging from the beginning. I also felt bogged down by the small mountain of reading, but managed to push through.</p>
      <p>This week was a little bit of a mixed bag on how I felt about the material. Some of it was review, but there were also a few new concepts I learned about. Before this bootcamp I had used quite a bit of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But I never really understood how <em>deep</em> you can get into CSS. The sheer amount of different ways you can select things in an HTML document is very overwhelming. JavaScript was similar for me. I am pretty comfortable with a couple of key concepts that I have practiced a lot in the past. Loops for example. I love me a good for loop. I still find my self getting overwhelmed, however, when I try to put multiple concepts together, like when a function starts to get more and more layers, and when the variables add up. I start to get a little nervous and sweaty.</p>
      <p>As for blog updates I played around a bit with adding a navbar at the top. I did cheat <em>slightly</em>. I copied it from a portfolio I put together when I was working through the free code camp curriculum. So… It is code that I wrote, I just wrote it over a year ago. I did have to tweak it to better fit this new blog situation. I also had fun playing with gradients and box shadow. I added some links new pages, now all I have to do is figure out some content to put on those pages.</p>

        <h2>Week two</h2>
        <h3><time datetime="2020-09-04">September 04, 2020</time></h3>
        <p>I made it through week two of code camp! Hooray! I feel like this week was much less overwhelming. Here’s to hoping I can keep up the pace. I was actually a little bit ahead of schedule, which you would think would be a good thing, but instead it just made me panic and feel like I must’ve forgotten something. I will admit, I was kind of dreading the pseudo coding assignment this week, but as I got into it, I found myself enjoying it. I was reminded of the saying, “how do you eat an elephant?”. Simple answer, one piece at a time.</p>
        <p>I decided to write pseudo code for my computerized sewing machine. I think it helped to choose an object with a very simple computer that I am already familiar with. Even still, it was still quite a challenge. It was very intimidating to see it as “the whole elephant”, but by taking it one piece at a time I was able to get through it. The hardest part was figuring out one piece of the puzzle, only to realize that in order for that piece to make sense, you need three other pieces to back it up. Or not being able to find a piece that you need, only to realize it was in front of you the whole time. You just gave it a stupid name.</p>
        <p>I am sure the more that I pseudo code, the more comfortable I will become with it. I think one of my struggles in the past with coding, has been getting too wrapped up in syntax and method, but having no idea how it applies to the big picture. I am excited to get better at pseudo code to help me better visualize the big picture.</p>

        <h2>Week one</h2>
        <h3><time datetime="2020-08-28">August 28, 2020</time></h3>
        <p>My first week of bootcamp went about how I expected it too. There has certainly been a lot of new information to absorb. Like, seriously, a lot of information. It has been a bit overwhelming but I at least feel more knowledgeable than I did at the beginning of the week. So far my biggest struggle as been with using Git and GitHub. Although I’m sure the more I use it, to more sense it will make to me. I actually had to set up the files for this blog twice, because I accidentally overrode my first index file with an older version. I didn’t know what to do so I just deleted everything and started over, but I did feel more confident setting it up the second time. I am excited to learn more about Git and GitHub, since I am sure we will be using it a lot.</p>
